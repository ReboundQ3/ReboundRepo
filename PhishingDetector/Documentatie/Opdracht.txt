AI ↔ Security: Build Fast, Think Deep

Context & Objective
AI is transforming cybersecurity — not just as a defensive or offensive tool, but also as a growing attack surface. In this assignment, you will prototype a small cybersecurity-related tool or proof-of-concept using AI technologies. 
As an assignment you can do one of the following options (own ideas approved by the teacher):
•	Use AI to build a security tool, possibilities are
o	SPAM/virus analysis
o	User behavior analysis
o	Ways to enrich access controls in order to account for more situational awareness
o	Log analysis as part of a SIEM application
o	Phishing email classifier using LLMs
o	LLM-powered log parser with anomaly detection
o	YARA rule generator using GPT
o	SOC automation assistant using AI scripting

•	Explore or demonstrate security risks in AI, for instance demonstrate technical attacks like 
o	Poisoning
o	Jail-braking
o	Input evasion
o	Model extraction
o	Prompt injection evaluator or testbed
o	LLM jailbreak probe (automated or manual)
o	Token leakage demo from overlong inputs
o	Fake model exploit or hallucination-based phishing

•	Or combine both approaches, for instance
o	Write code via vibe coding and analyse the code quality, look for CVEs
o	Explore AI tooling for attacks and look for methods to detect them
o	Explore GPT-tool or frameworks that can be used for attacks and give advise how to defend/detect
o	Build an LLM-powered assistant, then try to exploit it
o	Write a vulnerability scanner for insecure AI usage in APIs
Requirements/aspects to consider
The project should reflect the following aspects:
1.	How to use AI in an efficient way to produce handy scripts for (relatively) simple tasks.
2.	Explore security aspects like AI vulnerabilities or specific attack paths that involve AI
3.	Demonstrate the findings in a short report! Chose a form that fits best to the findings you want to demonstrate.
4.	Combine the demonstration with a clear message! 
Technical Depth & Complexity Requirement
Your project must include at least one of the following to demonstrate meaningful technical engagement:
•	Exploration and mitigation of a specific AI-related security risk, supported by practical testing or demonstration
•	Automation of a cybersecurity task that involves dynamic interaction (e.g., querying APIs, handling varied inputs, adapting behavior)
•	Implementation of a non-trivial algorithm or logic layer on top of AI outputs (e.g., custom filtering, correlation, threat scoring)Clear architectural design, modular code, and documentation showing engineering practices (e.g., error handling, logging, tests)
•	Integration of multiple AI tools or models (e.g., combining LLM with vision models or embedding tools)
•	Design and use of a realistic data pipeline or workflow involving input processing, AI analysis, and actionable output
Projects that simply copy-paste AI-generated code without meaningful customization, extension, or critical evaluation will not meet this requirement.


 

Deliverables
1.	Prototype + README (a group of 3)
o	Submit a working prototype (script or tool)
o	Include a README.md with setup instructions and how AI was used
2.	Short Report (max 3 pages)
o	Goal and scope of your project
o	AI tools/models used
o	Prompts used (with examples)
o	Security risks identified (either in your own tool or in AI)
o	Your reflection on reliability, safety, and ethics
3.	Presentation of the project:
o	Show the influence of AI 
o	Reaction to the feedback
o	Show the security aspects and what you have learnt in the process
Peer Review Session (Group-based)
•	In the review session, you will review another group’s projects thoroughly (week 6).
•	Each group must provide constructive feedback on the other project, focusing on:
o	Innovation and creativity
o	Effective use of AI
o	Security relevance and depth
o	Clarity and completeness of documentation
•	Your will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your project each other.
•	You will give feedback each other.
•	Each group will take the feedback and improve you work, and deliver a 15-minute presentation highlighting your work and insight to the whole class (week 7).
•	All group members are expected to attend the presentation and participate in the Q&A.

Assessment Criteria
Groups will be graded. 
Demo/Report (will be handed in): 40%
Review and feedback (review session week 6, two groups present to each other and give feedback): 30%
Presentation (presentation week 7 in front of the whole group) 30%
